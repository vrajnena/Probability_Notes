In this text file I am going to get familiar with some basic building blocks of Probabilty
 This note mostly cointains definitions

 Experiment - Any activity for which the outcome is not certain. Outcome is only known after the completion on Experiment.
 example - Drawing a card from deck, determinig the child birth etc..

 Sample Space - It is a set which contains all the possible outcomes of an experiment. Denoted by Ω .
 Example - Tossing a coin so Ω ={Heads,tails}

 Event  - Any subset E from sample Space.
 example - Determining the child birth Ω={male,female}  the event E would be if the child is either male or female.
 
 Some basic notation 
 ω - outcome of a random experiment
 Ω = {ω1,ω2,...ωn}
 Subset of Ω is denoted by capital letters.

 _
 A= complement or composite event

 Sure event or certain event - if an event contains all the possible outcome
